📊 Student Performance Analysis
Overview
This project explores student performance data to uncover insights into academic outcomes. Using Python and key data analysis libraries, we clean, transform, and visualize the dataset to identify patterns and correlations that influence student success.
🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Python: Core programming language
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy: Numerical operations
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional): Data visualization
📁 Dataset
The dataset includes student records with features such as:
- Gender, parental education level, lunch type
- Test preparation course status
- Scores in math, reading, and writing
📌 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize score distributions and correlations
- Identify factors affecting student performance
📈 Key Insights
- Students who completed test preparation tend to score higher
- Parental education level shows a positive correlation with student scores
- Lunch type may reflect socioeconomic factors influencing performance
